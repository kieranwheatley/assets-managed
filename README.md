# About Assets? Managed.

Assets? Managed. is an asset management application which focuses on blending the business efficiency focuses of IT Asset Management and the risk detection and prevention focus of Information Security Management Systems. By using this tool, organisations can get a clear overview of all their assets with information allowing them to be tracked through their entire lifecycle. The tool also check for known vulnerabilities using the NIST Vulnerability API and has a Windows Data Collection tool. This tool can be installed on end-user devices and, when ran (ideally on boot), will automatically report compliance data about the device including: last boot time and the disk encryption status.



## Project Management

The agile methodology is being used for project management during the development of this application. Notion is being used to provide a kanban board as well as the GANTT chart.

### Project Aim
The project aim was to develop an application to help combine asset management aims and provide organisations a platform for storing assets with automated data collection to check ISM compliance, detect vulnerabilities, and maximise assetâ€™s value through its lifecycle.

### Project Objectives
The objectives of this project set out to achieve the aim were:

- Develop a full-stack application asset management system.

- Ensure the application is a single source of truth.

- Automatically collect data from assets to keep information up-to date.

- Detect vulnerabilities in assets so they can be resolved.
